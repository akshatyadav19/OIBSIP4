Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy


To install these libraries, run the following command:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy



Dataset
The dataset is provided by Oasis Infobyte.

Model Training
To train the model, we first preprocess the text data by removing stop words, stemming, and tokenizing the words. We then convert the text into a numerical format using a bag-of-words approach. We then split the dataset into training and testing sets, and train a variety of machine learning algorithms, including using scikit-learn. We select the best performing algorithm and fine-tune it using hyperparameter tuning.

Results
The final model achieves an accuracy of on the test set.
